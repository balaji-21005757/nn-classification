# Developing a Neural Network Classification Model

## AIM

To develop a neural network classification model for the given dataset.

## Problem Statement

An automobile company has plans to enter new markets with their existing products. After intensive market research, theyâ€™ve decided that the behavior of the new market is similar to their existing market.

In their existing market, the sales team has classified all customers into 4 segments (A, B, C, D ). Then, they performed segmented outreach and communication for a different segment of customers. This strategy has work exceptionally well for them. They plan to use the same strategy for the new markets.

You are required to help the manager to predict the right group of the new customers.

## Neural Network Model

Include the neural network model diagram.

## DESIGN STEPS

### STEP 1:
Import the necessary packages & modules.
### STEP 2:
Load and read the dataset(Customer.csv)
### STEP 3:
Perform pre processing and clean the dataset and find the null value.
### STEP 4:
Encode categorical value into numerical values using ordinal/label/one hot encoding.
### STEP 5:
Visualize the data using different plots in seaborn(Heatmap, Distplot, Scatterplot).
### STEP 6:
Normalize the values and split the values for x and y(Segmentation).
### STEP 7:
Build the deep learning model with appropriate layers and depth.
### STEP 8:
Analyze the model using different metrics.
### STEP 9:
Plot a graph for Training Loss, Validation Loss Vs Iteration & for Accuracy, Validation Accuracy vs Iteration.
### STEP 10:
Save the model using pickle by importing pickle.
### STEP 11:
Using the DL model predict for some random inputs
### STEP 12:
Build the neural network model for the appropriate layers and depth to visualise represent the model.
